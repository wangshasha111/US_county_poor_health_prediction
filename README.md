# US_county_poor_health_prediction
 Data Mining through Decision Tree Cost Complexity Pruning

 This project is for the final project of STAT 477 at the Wharton School of Business at the Universith of Pennsylvania in the fall of 2020. 

 The goal of my project is to apply decision tree analysis to a county-level dataset (project_477.csv) to detect the most predictive factor of the health index. The dictionary of the dataset can be found in FP_data_dictionary.doc.pdf

 The takeaway from the project is that the most predictive factors of a county's health index are, in order of significance, life expectancy, insufficient sleep, smoking and excessive drinking, adult obesity, and the percentage of females.


 The data concerns health, economic and demographic characteristics of counties in the US. The unit of analysis is the county. If you are interested in the data source it is [https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/). 

 I output a jupyter notebook FP_starter_ShashaWang.ipynb containing both the codes and the description of each step of the project. Its PDF and html version are also provided in FP_starter_ShashaWang.pdf and FP_starter_ShashaWang.slides.html
