# US_county_poor_health_prediction
 Data Mining through Decision Tree Cost Complexity Pruning

 This project is for the final project of STAT 477 at the Universith of Pennsylvania in the fall of 2020.

 The goal of the project is to apply decision tree analysis to a county-level dataset (project_477.csv) to detect the most predictive factor of the health index. The dictionary of the dataset can be found in FP_data_dictionary.doc.pdf


 The data concerns health, economic and demographic characteristics of counties in the US. The unit of analysis is the county. If you are interested in the data source it is [https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/).
